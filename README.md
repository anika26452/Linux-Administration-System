## What is Shell?

Shell is a computer program that takes keyboards commands and passes them to the Operating System to carry out. There are several different shells available for Unix; the most popular are described here - sh, bash, zsh, csh, ksh. When using a graphical user interface, we need another program called a terminal emulator to interact with the shell which is simply called **Terminal**. To open terminal press ___Ctrl+Alt+T___. Once it comes up, we can see **shell prompt**. It shows current directory & the last character will be dollar sign(%).

> If the last Character is pound sign(#), it says, the terminal has the **Superuser Privilages**. This mean either we are logged in as the root user or the terminal is using **Superuser Privilages**.
